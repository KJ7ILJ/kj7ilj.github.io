<h2 style = "text-align:center">10/28/2019: Penguin Video Link Considerations</h2>
<p>
This update came a little earlier than expected, since I had much less trouble than I
initially anticipated figuring out discrete cosine transforms. "Penguin" is the name I've
chosen for my HD video link. There's no particular reason for the name, other than the fact
that I just happen to like penguins and I thought it sounds good. Anyways, on to the post.
</p>
<p>
Penguin will use a combination of the 70cm and 23cm bands for video transmission,
and the 6m band for peripheral communication. The video stream will be in .xyz format, which
should provide enough speed for low-latency video streaming while maintaining a high
compression ratio. The stream size is 1280x720 pixels at 30 frames per second, which requires
about 83 MB/s of bandwidth uncompressed. Applying XYZ compression to this raw stream drops the
required bandwidth down to around only 3 MB/s. Using the Shannon-Hartley theorem, it can be
determined that at the target minimum SNR of 0.3 the required frequency bandwidth is 7.926 MHz
(which I will round up to 8MHz in the design).
</p>
<p>
It's a well known fact that HD video systems typically have issues with graceful video breakup,
since losing an adequate signal means that instead of getting bits and pieces of your stream and
some static, you just lose whole chunks of your stream or the entire stream turns into a blue screen.
While achieving graceful video breakup is a priority in this project, I'm going to get a working
prototype done before I focus on this aspect.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I'm working on making a breakout board for the TVP5150AM1 so I can experiment with
capturing video coming from a standard FPV camera using a Raspberry Pi or my desktop computer. I'm
also trying to get OpenCV to work in Visual Studio so that I can work on capturing and compressing
a live stream in XYZ format.
