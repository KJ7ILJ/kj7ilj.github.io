<p>I am currently a high school sophomore at BASIS Oro Valley in Arizona. I spend most of my time 
sharpening my skills in one of several 3D modelling/simulation programs, designing rockets and 
drones, working on my newest PCB, or soldering, although I also enjoy spending time at my local
HAM radio club and rocketry range, programming, and learning new things. I AM ALSO UNEMPLOYED
*cough cough*. My resume is available <a href = "resume.pdf">here</a> if you would like more information
about my education and certifications.</p>
