"text-align:center">11/16/2019 SARA Launch, Current Projects</h2> <p>Last Saturday, I went to my 
local rocketry club's monthly launch. I flew my Madcow DX3 on a CTI G57 reloadable motor. This 
was my first flight with a reloadable motor, and all things considered it went okay. I think the 
rocket flew off to the left of the launch site because the top launch lug was deformed after the 
last launch. I'll probably remove the launch lugs and print a fly away rail guide instead. 
According to some basic simulations from ThrustCurve, on a G57 the DX3 accelerated off the pad 
at 14.7G's, reached a top speed of 310mph, and reached an altitude of slightly over 1700 feet, 
making this my highest-flying launch to date.</p>

<p> I've also been working on some small rockets that 
I can build easily and cheaply to test small dataloggers, gyroscopes, and other instrumentation. 
They run on 24mm motors, and for an average, medium-altitude flight they use Estes D12 motors. 
I'm naming this line of small rockets the Luyten series, after the small binary star 
system 8.7 light years from Earth. I've been working on two different payloads for the two rockets 
I built: a datalogger and a gyroscope nosecone. The datalogger logs altitude, temperature, 
acceleration, and velocity on a micro SD card, and an integrated buzzer allows the rocket to be 
found easily after the flight is complete. The gyroscope nosecone is only 30mm longer than the 
standard Luyten nosecone, and only 10-15 grams heavier. The gyroscope consists of a speed controller, 
small brushed motor, and a lead flywheel. When the flywheel is spun up, it should contribute 
significantly to the overall stability of the rocket.</p>
<p>
Another thing I've been thinking about doing is experimenting with spinning the entire rocket versus 
having a spinning gyroscope in the nose cone and taking data on their stability in flight.
