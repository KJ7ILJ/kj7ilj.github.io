This is a short clip of a flight I did today with the Nimbus VTOL. I used a Mavic Mini to film
it, and really only managed to get video of the takeoff and landing although I am going to try to
get better video tomorrow.</br></br>

One thing that is evident right off the bat is the fact that the Nimbus kicks up a lot of dust.
This isn't so much of a problem in its current configuration, but when expensive and sensitive
camera equipment is added, the dust could become a big problem. To solve the dust problem, I'm going
to place a tarp on the ground under the Nimbus takeoff and landing area for my next flight.</br></br>

I didn't use GPS modes for this flight as per the manual's suggestion. Qstabilize, FBWA, and RTL (unused)
were the only modes I had on my 3-position switch.</br></br>

Additionally, considering how heavy and strangely shaped the Nimbus VTOL is in comparison to other planes, I was surprised
at how fast it cruised in FBWA and its good handling characteristics in Qstabilize.</br></br>

The Nimbus is a very capable aircraft. I'm looking forward to using it in the setting it was designed for,
although that time may not come for a while.
