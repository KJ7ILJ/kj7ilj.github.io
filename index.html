<h2 style = "text-align:center">10/7/2019: HD Video System for UAVs</h2>
<p>Over the past 2 years or so, I have been working on my Nimbus project. For those of you 
who may not know what the Nimbus project is, it's a VTOL made by Foxtech that I have been designing 
my own systems for so that it can provide HD and thermal video over long range and extreme terrain. 
The single most
challenging part of this project has been the radio system. In fact, the Nimbus project was
the source of my interest in radios, DSP, and linear algebra. Almost every single project 
I have worked on over the past 2 years has been connected to my Nimbus project in one way
or another. In fact, the Nimbus is the reason I started learning PCB design and amateur 
RF and electrical engineering. So, let's move on to the meat of this post: the video system.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of solutions for creating asynchronous mesh networks of telemetry radios for control of Mavlink 
enabled devices have existed for a while now and are readily available on the commercial market. One
of these is the Australian company RFDesigns's RFD900x telemetry modem, which I am using to control 
the Nimbus. However, nothing exists at the moment that can transmit HD video over long distances and 
connect to a large network of repeaters to cover an area spanning over 150 miles. So, I need to design 
my own system to do this. The general concept is fairly simple -- An analog video input is digitized, 
compressed, and transmitted to a network of repeaters. When you get more specific is when things start 
to appear complicated. An analog video input is passed to 
a device that converts the colorspace from analog RGB to digital YCbCr. This digital image is then 
broken into chunks, compressed using the XYZ compression algorithm, and each chunk is broadcasted 
simultaneously using a spread-spectrum digital protocol. The bands that I am planning to 
use for this are the 70cm and 33cm bands. On the 70cm band, baud rate is restricted to 56kbaud, 
but above the 70cm band there are no restrictions on baud rate. Due to these restrictions, I will 
probably just use the 70cm band for peripheral digital communications such as checksums and other 
methods of verifying signal integrity.

I will continue to update my website on the progress of this project as I move forward. However, the 
next update on this specific topic may not be for a little while so I can work out the details some 
more.
