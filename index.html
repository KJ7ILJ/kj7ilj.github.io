<p>
At the moment, I'm working through Udacity's AI for Trading nanodegree program. I'm really enjoying
it at the moment, and I'm learning a lot of methods for analyzing stocks that I'm looking forward
to integrating into my portfolio. Here's an example from the most recent project I completed for
this course.
<img src="img/jaccard_sim_1_graph.png" class="center" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
This graph shows the jaccard similarity on a bag of words generated from Amazon 10-K filings.
After computing TFIDF vectors, cosine similarity, converting the data to a Pandas dataframe
and then to Alphalens format, calculating factor returns and doing turnover analysis, the
sharpe ratio of each alpha factor generated was calculated. "Litigious" had the largest
sharpe ratio at 1.5. I plan to publish the code for all of my projects on Github when I
finish the course.</br></br>

Additionally, I played around with translating images in Python using
Tesseract OCR and Google Translate's python library. Here's the translation of a
cover of an old Russian armorer's manual for the AK-47:
<img src="img/fieldmanual_cover_1.jpg" class="center">
<img src="img/ak_translation_1.png" class="center">

You can see that there is one error in Tesseract's conversion of letters
on the cover to text (СССР was detected as СФСР), but the overall
meaning of the cover remains unchanged. Fortunately, СФСР is SFSR in English, which
is the acronym for the Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, another word for Soviet
Russia.
