<h2 style = "text-align:center">10/6/2019: OSARC V1</h2>
<p>OSARC V1, or the "Open Source Advanced Rocketry Computer", is a project I've been working on for the past couple weeks. OSARC V1 is a 
traditional dual-deploy altimeter, GPS tracker, datalogger, and stabilization system all in one board.
</p>
<p>
OSARC V1 is based around the ATMEGA328P-AU
microcontroller, an 8-bit AVR from Atmel capable of running the Arduino bootloader. The ATMEGA is connected to motion sensors, a GPS, and a 425-502MHz
transceiver. The ATMEGA328P-AU (from now on referred to as the microcontroller/MCU) runs off of a 16MHz crystal, enabling operation at the highest
speed possible. The MCU connects to a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer/temperature sensor, and GPS through a combination of I2C, SPI,
and UART communication. All sensors except for the magnetometer are connected through either SPI or UART to maximize connection speed. The
magnetometer was connected through I2C to avoid the hassle and increased processing times of bit-bashing a 2-wire SPI setup.
</p>
<p>
The sensors that enable OSARC V1 to determine its position and perform tasks accordingly are:
<ul>- An ADXL377BCPZ-RL7 200G 3-axis accelerometer </ul>
<ul>- A L3GD20HTR 2000dps 3-axis gyroscope </ul> 
<ul>- An IIS2MDCTR magnetometer </ul> 
<ul>- A BMP388 barometer/temperature sensor </ul>
<ul>- A uBlox MAX-M8W GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/Beidou module </ul> 
</p>
<p>
Using these sensors, OSARC V1 can perform a variety of tasks, including stabilization ("heading hold") along the X, Y, and Z axes, event timing,
datalogging, and any other function that may require motion and/or position data to complete.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining a GPS lock for as large of a proportion of the rocket's flight as possible is challenging. Potential spinning and changing
attitude between launch and landing makes it hard to keep the required number of satellites in view of the GPS for a large portion of the
flight. To combat this problem, OSARC V1 has two GPS antennas. One is a small omnidirectional antenna designed to allow the rocket to maintain lock
when the primary antenna is not facing the sky, and the second (primary) antenna is any GPS antenna that can be connected to the board through
a uFL connector. I recommend a passive ceramic patch antenna, although any antenna providing no more than 3.5dB of gain at maximum should work.
OSARC V1 has two ADL5541ACPZ-R7 amplifiers to add 11.2dB of gain to both the omnidirectional and primary antennas. The signal strengths of each
amplified signal are compared and the better signal is passed to the GPS module through a diversity controller. Since the maximum safe
input signal strength on the MAX-M8W GPS module is 15dBm, you need to pick a primary antenna that will not overload the GPS receiver.
OSARC V1 is designed for a 3.04dB maximum, 18x18mm Taoglas ceramic patch antenna compatible with GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo. Countries using
Beidou satellites should choose an alternate antenna with similar specifications for their rockets.
</p>
<p>
OSARC V1 is not compatible with any sort of guidance system that cannot be controlled by a PWM or digital signal. OSARC V1's guidance
outputs are set up as standard servo plugs so that servo-controlled fins can be connected to OSARC V1 and used to guide the rocket. The pins
used for guidance equipment on OSARC V1 can also be used as digital inputs if needed. 
</p>
<p>
The microcontroller's 8-bit architecture provides a good platform for simple development of basic stabilization and datalogging programs,
but overall limits OSARC V1's performance. Specifically, the AVR's lack of ability to perform true floating-point math means that GPS coordinates
cannot be processed at a high enough rate GPS-based guidance to be feasible. Additionally, limits placed on commercial uBlox GPS modules by their 
manufacturer prevent operation beyond speeds over 500m/s, although such operation is allowed by ITAR under certain circumstances. My guess is that
they put the 500m/s limit on their GPS units specifically because they don't want people guiding rockets with them.
</p>
<p>
<div><b>Advice and legal disclaimer:</b></div>
I would not recommend designing your own guidance system
unless you are willing to destroy or lose your rocket.
Additionally, the guidance system on any publicly released version of OSARC is not for
targeting people or property with. It is purely for stabilization during flight. While I encourage you to work on anything that captures your
interest related to rockets, make sure that you follow all applicable laws when doing so. By using OSARC hardware, software, systems, etc., 
you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your actions or their consequences. Anything that happens, regardless of what it is or why it
happened, is entirely your problem and legally your responsibility.
